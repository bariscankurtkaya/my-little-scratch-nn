My Little Scratch Neural Network

In python file I watched the [Samson Zhang - Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU) video to implement.

You can download the dataset from [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data?select=train.csv)
